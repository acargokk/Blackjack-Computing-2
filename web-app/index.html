                The objective of Blackjack is to get as close to 21 points as possible without going over it.
                <br>
                <br>
                All the cards have their face values in points (3 is 3 points, 7 is 7 points etc.).
                The face cards (J, Q, and K) are worth 10 points.
                The Ace is either worth 1 or 11 points, whichever is more useful.
                <br>
                <br>
                The player starts with 2 cards and has the option to hit or stand.
                Hit means to ask for another card, and stand means to stop.
                One card of the dealer (called the "upcard") is visible to everyone, so the player should consider that card as well when making decisions.
                The player also has the option to double down after the first two cards,
                which doubles the bet amount and the player gets only one more card.
                In this case, the card is dealt horizontally to indicate that the player can not receive more cards.
                <br>
                <br>
                If the player goes over 21 points (aka "to bust"), dealer wins and player loses their bet.
                If the player gets dealt a 21 from the first two cards, it is called a blackjack and player wins 5:2 of the bet.
                The player also wins if they don't go bust after having 5 cards. This is a variation rule called the "5-Card Charlie".
                <br>
                <br>
                Once the player turn ends, the dealer starts to play.
                By casino rules, the dealer has to draw cards until he reaches 17, then has to stop.
                After both the player and the dealer plays, and if neither of them went bust, the one closer to 21 wins.
